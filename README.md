Purpose of this recipe project is to practise creating a recipe website using techniques learned in the previous odin project lessons. 

For example making a html-boilerplate, creating text, using lists (unordered, ordered), creating links to images and different pages in the website

As of right now, I have created an index page (homepage) with a link to one recipe page (Easy Meatloaf) and an image folder.

I will still need to create couple more recipes before the project is complete
