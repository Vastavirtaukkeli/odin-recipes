Purpose of this recipe website project is to practise HTML-coding by creating a recipe website using techniques learned in the previous odin project lessons. 

For example making a html-boilerplate, creating and editing text, using lists (unordered, ordered), creating links to images and different pages in the website

All in all there is an index page(homepage) and three different pages containing food recipes. From the index page there are links to these recipes and a link back to the index page from the recipe sites.

Recipe pages have an image of the food, an ingredient list (unordered) and steps for preparing the dish (ordered).
